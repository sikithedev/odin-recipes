  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Blend roasted broccoli, cream cheese, and vegetable broth to make a simple, yet delicious soup. Roasting broccoli enhances its flavor, allowing nutty and sweet flavors to develop.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>5 cups chopped broccoli florets and stalks</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
    <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon lemon pepper, or more as needed</li>
    <li>crushed red pepper flakes to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Place broccoli, onion, garlic, and olive oil in a large bowl and toss to coat evenly. Place on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.</li>
    <li>Roast vegetables until soft, 30 to 35 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Chop 1/4 cup of broccoli florets; set aside for garnish.</li>
    <li>Combine remaining vegetables with vegetable broth, cream cheese, and lemon pepper in a high-powered blender or food processor in batches. Puree soup until smooth.</li>
    <li>Pour soup into a saucepan over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with additional lemon pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls. Garnish with reserved chopped broccoli and crushed red pepper.</li>
